# Demonstration Application for HashiCorp Tools (Consul, Terraform, Nomad, Vault Eventually...)

[Multi-tier application (3)](https://github.com/codyde/hashi-demo-app), responsive, and leverages technologies and languages that are common place in developer communities. It was designed as cloud native first from a Docker perspective (included is the docker compose file) but also includes the Kubernetes YAML file for deploying to a Kubernetes cluster.

## Application Description

# Tier 1 - Frontend Application - User Presentation 

* Angular front end with VMware ClarityUI (https://vmware.github.io/clarity/)
* NGINX hosting Angular app and also providing reverse proxy functionality to the App Tier. Reason for this is since Angular is a client side extension, connecting to the app directly causes it to fail since it can't resolve DNS
* Messaging Application leverages Sockets.IO to open a Socket channel between the client and server for rapid updates

# Tier 2 - App Tier - API 

* Python Flask based application
* Handles interaction between the Frontend and Database tier, and the Frontend and the websocket interaction
* Scalable to N number of pods 

# Tier 3 - DB Tier - Data 

* Postgresql 10 database (named 'posts')
* Precreated table (named 'textData') 
* Do not scale this pod; bad things will happen
